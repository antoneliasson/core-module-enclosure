Errata
------

* The cutout for the USB connector is *just* big enough, making it somewhat
  difficult to insert the core module. Should make it slightly taller.
* Next time, separate WallThickness and FloorThickness even if they are the
  same. Should make the code more readable by being more clear what is being
  referred to.
* Make the snaps wider
* Simplify snaps
